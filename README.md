# AMAZON SALES ANALYSIS
I collected data on online amazon sales in India with a focus on discounted and rated products. I further cleaned the data and created a dashboard to show my results

## OBJECTIVE
Our main objective is to identify which products received a good rating and those that experienced heavily discounts. In addition we wanted to distinguish if there was indeed a relationship between discounts on products and the customer ratings.

## FINDINGS/RESULTS
We establshed that there is no direct impact or relationship between discounts and product ratings. This means that just because a product has higher discounts, clents/buyers will rate it based on other factors.
